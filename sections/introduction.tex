\TODO{What is it in simple terms (title)?}
\TODO{Why should anyone care?}
\TODO{What was my contribution?}
\TODO{What you are doing in each section (a sentence or two per section)}

Tip: if it's hard for you to start writing, then try to split it into smaller parts, e.g., if the title is ``Type Inference for a Cryptographic Protocol Prover Tool'' then the ``What is it'' can be divided into ``what is type inference'', ``what is cryptographic protocol'' and ``what is the prover tool''. These three can also be split into smaller parts etc.
